Expression data from RNA-seq experiments of C2C12 myotubes treated with Ethanol for multiple timepoints.

These are the expression data (in raw counts) for the experiments performed in the following publication:

Kumar A, Davuluri G, Welch N, Kim A, Gangadhariah M, Allawy A, Priyadarshini A, McMullen MR, Sandlers Y, Willard B, Hoppel CL, Nagy LE, Dasarathy S. Oxidative stress mediates ethanol-induced skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulated proteostasis. (2019) Free Radic Biol Med

C2C12 murine myoblasts (ATCC; CRL 1772) were grown to confluence in proliferation medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), containing 10% fetal bovine serum followed by differentiation in DMEM with 2% horse serum for 48 h as previously described [13]. Myotubes were then exposed to 100 mM of ethanol for 6 hours and 24 hours.

Total RNA was extracted, libraries generated and sequenced, and bioinformatics analyses were performed by Novogene Inc. Using their standard pipeline for mouse transcriptome studies reads were aligned using theTopHat2. Gene expression was quantified by HTseq v0.6.1.
